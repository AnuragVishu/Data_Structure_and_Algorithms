# SEARCHING ALGORITHMS


 *Searching algorithms*, as the name suggests, are designed to check whether an element is present/   stored in any data structure and retreve it if the algorithm finds it. 
There are two categories in which these algorithms can generally be classified:

 1. ### Sequencial Search
 The linear traversing is done over a data structure to check every element stored. *eg. Linear Search* is an example of Sequencial search.
 
 2. ### Interval Search
 The specifically designed algorithms are used to search for elements in sorted a sorted data structures. *Interval Search Algorithms* are more efficient then Sequencial search Algorithms. *eg. Binary Search* is an example of Interval search.
